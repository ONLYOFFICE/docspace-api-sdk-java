   * Delete an encryption key
   * Removes one encryption key pair from the calling user's own key set and answers 204 with no body. The pair is  named by the `id` of an entry of `GET api/2.0/privacyroom/keys`; the caller's other pairs stay as they are.  The call is destructive and cannot be repeated: the key material is gone for good, a second delete of the same  `id`, like an `id` that was never stored, is answered with 404, and there is no parameter for another user's  keys, so an authenticated member only ever deletes their own while a guest is refused. Deleting the last key  the caller holds locks them out of the private rooms they belong to, their own rooms included: the rooms and  their content survive untouched and stay listed as private, but `GET api/2.0/privacyroom/{roomId}/access` then  refuses the caller until a new key is stored with `POST api/2.0/privacyroom/keys`. Before DocSpace 4.0 the  call answered 200 with the caller's remaining keys, so a client that read that list has to call  `GET api/2.0/privacyroom/keys` instead.
