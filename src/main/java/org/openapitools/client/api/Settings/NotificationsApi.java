Any signed-in member may ask for it, whatever its role, and no permission is demanded. A  channel appears only when the notification service of the running installation is configured with a sender of  that name, so the list can be shorter than the two names above, and an empty list means that configuration  names no channel this build implements. `email.sender` is reported as enabled whenever it is listed, while  `telegram.sender` is reported as enabled only while the portal has a Telegram bot name and token stored, which  is what `POST api/2.0/settings/authservice` writes. An enabled channel says nothing about the caller: a member  also has to connect their own Telegram account, for which `GET api/2.0/settings/telegram/link` hands out the  link and `GET api/2.0/settings/telegram/check` reports the outcome. Which kinds of notification a member  receives is a separate setting, read with `GET api/2.0/settings/notification/{type}`.
